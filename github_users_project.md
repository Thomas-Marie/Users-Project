# Github Users Project

## The API
https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search/search?apiVersion=2022-11-28

## The technology

You are free to choose between the following technologies:
- Vanilla Javascript / Typescript OR React JS / TS
- Vanilla CSS OR Tailwindcss

## The project:

The application should have a presentational header and a footer.

The core of the application should be a two columns layout (next to each other on desktop)

### Left section:

On the left section, we should see a list of cards containing the first 10 github users.

Each card should display the following informations about the user
- the name
- the profile picture

When clicking on a card, further informations will be fetched for that user and displayed in the right section.

### Right section

On the right section, after a user card was clicked, we should present a big card displaying:
- his name
- his avatar
- the list of repositories for that user, each of them rendered as a link that takes us to the selected repository (on a new tab)

## Delivery

The project should be public on github and optionally deployed to github pages


Good Luck
